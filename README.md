#HIT Modeler

##Why should you use HIT Modeler?

Do you need to create HIT model? 
Are you fed up with finishing ERD in MS Paint?
Do you need a tool which combines graphical model with entity definitions?

If you answered "yes" to at least one of the questions above, HIT modeler is definitely for you.

##How do you use it?

Since HIT Modeler is based on Java and JRuby, you need both of them.

Then you just get the application sources and run this:

jruby bin/application.rb

That's all... Now you can start creating your model by simple selecting the entity types from the toolbar and putting them on the canvas. HIT Modeler is simple app but it does the job.

##What can you do with the application?

Anything you want :)
Basically, HIT Modeler is intended to create ERD model for HIT methodics. You can also insert the definitions to both entities and relations. Anytime you need, the project can be saved as XML file and loaded later. There is also nice possibility to generate HTML containing the textual description ofyour project, i.e. list of the entities, relations, descriptions etc.
